About The Project

This is a simple hangman game implemented in python. This game will generate a random word from the word_list and user needs to guess the letter that is present in the chosen random word. For each wrong guess you will loose a life and stages of live will be printing out. You have only 6 lives in this game. For each correct guess it will show you the guessed letter and also notify you for the letter that you have already guessed.
